# image_classifier_webapp

Hey guys! As part of Siraj Raval's course [Make Money With Machine Learning](https://www.machinelearningcourse.io/courses/make-money), the first assignment is to develop an image classification web application using Tensorflow.js. I followed the [Google CodeLabs Tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/js/tutorials/transfer/image_classification) to use the pre-trained image classification model called MobileNet and train a model on top to make predictions through the webcam.
